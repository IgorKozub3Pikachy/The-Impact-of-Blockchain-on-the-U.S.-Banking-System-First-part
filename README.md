Introduction to Blockchain
Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger system where transactions are recorded across many computers, ensuring data transparency and security. It allows peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries, making it an appealing solution for financial institutions looking to streamline operations and reduce costs.

Key Blockchain Characteristics:
Decentralization: No central authority, reducing reliance on intermediaries like banks.
Transparency: Every transaction is recorded in a publicly accessible ledger.
Security: Cryptographic techniques ensure the integrity of transactions.
Immutability: Once recorded, data cannot be altered or deleted.
Blockchain’s Role in Disrupting Traditional Banking
Blockchain’s potential to disrupt the banking industry is significant. Here are some key areas where blockchain can challenge traditional banking models:

1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
Blockchain enables the creation of decentralized financial systems that operate without intermediaries (e.g., decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading).
Impact: Traditional banks may lose control over financial products like loans, mortgages, and savings accounts as DeFi protocols offer more accessible and often lower-cost alternatives.
2. Cross-Border Payments
Blockchain-based remittances like Ripple allow for faster and cheaper cross-border transactions, bypassing the traditional correspondent banking system.
Impact: Banks can reduce transaction fees, and remittance providers can offer more efficient services.
3. Tokenization of Assets
Blockchain enables the creation of digital tokens representing real-world assets such as real estate, stocks, and commodities.
Impact: Investment banks can facilitate easier and more liquid trading of traditionally illiquid assets.
